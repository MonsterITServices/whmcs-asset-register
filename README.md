WHMCS Asset Manager
The Asset Manager is a comprehensive addon module for WHMCS that allows you to track and manage your clients' IT assets directly within your WHMCS installation. Keep a detailed, organized inventory of everything from servers and desktops to software licenses and peripherals, all linked to your clients.

✨ Key Features
Complete Asset Lifecycle Management: Create, edit, and delete assets for your clients.

Customizable Asset Types: Define your own asset categories (like Servers, Laptops, etc.) to fit your business needs.

Flexible Custom Fields: Add specific data fields to each asset type for detailed tracking.

Client & Contact Assignment: Assign assets directly to a client and, optionally, to a specific contact within that client's account.

Bulk Import/Export: Easily import existing asset data or export your register using CSV files.

Automated Warranty Notifications: A cron job automatically sends notifications for assets with expiring warranties.

Client Area Portal: Optionally allow clients to view and manage their own assets.

Seamless WHMCS Integration: A dedicated assets panel appears on the client's summary page in the admin area.

🚀 How It Works: Admin Area
The admin area provides a powerful and intuitive interface for managing the entire asset register.

Central Asset Dashboard
Get a complete overview of all assets in your system. You can filter the list by client or contact, and perform quick actions like adding a new asset, importing, or exporting.

Detailed Asset Information
When adding or editing an asset, you can track a wide range of crucial information, including:

Serial Number, Product Number, and MAC Address

IP Address details (Static or Dynamic)

Purchase and Warranty End Dates

Status (Active, Inactive, Archived)

Private Admin Notes

Any custom fields you've created!

Asset Types & Customization
Create and manage different types of assets to keep your register organized. Default types like Server, Desktop, and Laptop are included, and you can add any others you need.

Client Profile Integration
The module adds an "Assets" panel directly to the client's profile page, giving you instant access to their inventory without leaving the client summary.

Powerful Settings
Configure the module to work exactly how you want. You can enable or disable client area access, set up warranty notifications, and control data retention.

👤 How It Works: Client Area
Empower your clients by giving them direct access to view and manage their own assets through the WHMCS client area.

"My Assets" Portal
If enabled, a "My Assets" link is added to the client area navbar. Clients can see a clear list of their assigned assets, view details, and, if you allow it, add or delete assets themselves.

Simple Asset Management
Clients can easily add new assets using a simplified form, helping you keep the asset register up-to-date with minimal effort.

🛠️ Installation
